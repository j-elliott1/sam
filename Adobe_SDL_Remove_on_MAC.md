1. Executive Summary

The purpose of this project is to address the issue of SDL (Shared Device Licensing) licenses being retained on old devices, preventing the deployment of these licenses on approved devices. Due to the existing constraints, the indiviual site IT Departments are unable to manually image the devices, resulting in a need for an automated and scalable solution. This proposal recommends utilizing JAMF to create and deploy a standardized macOS image across the affected devices, ensuring proper software licensing and compliance.

2. Problem Statement

Recently, during the renewal of Adobe Creative Cloud (CC) and SDL licenses, it was discovered that some outdated devices retained SDL licenses, creating deployment conflicts. The current situation prevents the SDL licenses from being deployed on the correct, approved devices. Given that IT cannot manually re-image the devices due to resource constraints, an alternative approach is required to resolve the issue effectively and in a timely manner.

3. Objective

To develop and deploy a standardized macOS image using JAMF, targeting the devices retaining old SDL licenses. This will streamline the re-imaging process, ensuring that all devices are correctly licensed and compliant without needing manual intervention from IT.

4. Project Scope

In Scope:
• Create a macOS image that includes all required software, configurations, without SDL licenses.
• Use JAMF to automate the deployment of the macOS image to affected devices.
• Testing the image on a subset of devices to verify deployment success and address potential issues.
• Coordination with the advanced desktop team for image development and testing.

Out of Scope:
• Manual re-imaging of individual devices by IT staff.
• Deployment of images to devices not directly related to SDL licensing issues.

5. Approach

1. Requirements Gathering: Collaborate with the Advanced Desktop (Enterprise Ops) and Campus IT teams to identify the specific software and configurations needed for the macOS image.
2. Image Development: Build a standardized macOS image using JAMF that includes:
• Required applications and updates
• Security policies and settings
3. Testing: Deploy the image to a select group of devices to test for compatibility and proper license functionality.
4. Deployment: Once testing is complete, roll out the image to all affected devices using JAMF’s automated deployment capabilities.
5. Monitoring and Support: Monitor the deployment process and provide technical support as needed to address any issues that arise.

7. Resource Requirements

Personnel:
• Advanced Desktop Team: For image development and JAMF expertise
• IT Business Operations: For software licensing and compliance verification
• IT Support: For troubleshooting during deployment

Tools:
• JAMF Pro for image creation and deployment
• Access to affected devices for testing and deployment
8. Risks and Mitigation

Risk	Probability	Impact	Mitigation
Image deployment failure	Medium	High	Conduct thorough testing on a sample set of devices before full 
deployment
Devices not receiving updates	Low	Medium	Ensure proper network configuration and device communication with
 JAMF server
Licensing issues after deployment	Low	High	Pre-validate SDL licenses and configurations on test devices


9. Budget

• JAMF Pro licensing costs (if not already available)
• No additional hardware requirements are anticipated

10. Success Criteria

• Successful deployment of the macOS image to all affected devices without manual IT intervention.
• Zero issues reported regarding software incompatibility or license non-compliance.

11. Conclusion

Deploying a standardized macOS image using JAMF offers an effective and efficient solution to resolving the SDL licensing issues on affected devices. This approach will ensure all devices are compliant, with minimal manual intervention from IT, providing a scalable and automated solution for future needs.
