What are the Basic Symbols of a Flowchart?
Let's go over each flowchart symbol individually.
 
Start/End Symbol
The terminator symbol marks the starting or ending point of the system. It usually contains the word "Start" or "End."
 
Action or Process Symbol
A box can represent a single step ("add two cups of flour"), or an entire sub-process ("make bread") within a larger process.
 
Document Symbol
A printed document or report.
 
Multiple Documents Symbol
Represents multiple documents in the process
 
Decision Symbol
A decision or branching point. Lines representing different decisions emerge from different points of the diamond.
 
Input/Output Symbol
Represents material or information entering or leaving the system, such as customer order (input) or a product (output).
 
Manual Input Symbol
Represents a step where a user is prompted to enter information manually.
 
Preparation Symbol
Represents a set-up to another step in the process.
 
Connector Symbol
Indicates that the flow continues where a matching symbol (containing the same letter) has been placed.
 
Or Symbol
Indicates that the process flow continues in more than two branches.
 
Summoning Junction Symbol
Indicates a point in the flowchart where multiple branches converge back into a single process.
 
Merge Symbol
Indicates a step where two or more sub-lists or sub-processes become one.
 
Collate Symbol
Indicates a step that orders information into a standard format.
 
Sort Symbol
Indicates a step that organizes a list of items into a sequence or sets based on some pre-determined criteria.
 
Subroutine Symbol
Indicates a sequence of actions that perform a specific task embedded within a larger process. This sequence of actions could be described in more detail on a separate flowchart.
 
Manual Loop Symbol
Indicates a sequence of commands that will continue to repeat until stopped manually.
 
Loop Limit Symbol
Indicates the point at which a loop should stop.
 
Delay Symbol
Indicates a delay in the process.
 
Data Storage or Stored Data Symbol
Indicates a step where data gets stored.
 
Database Symbol
Indicates a list of information with a standard structure that allows for searching and sorting.
 
Internal Storage Symbol
Indicates that information was stored in memory during a program, used in software design flowcharts.
 
Display Symbol
Indicates a step that displays information.
 
Off Page
Indicates that the process continues off page.
